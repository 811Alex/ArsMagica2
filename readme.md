Ars Magica 2 - Reborn 1.10.2
========
This is a fork from Growlith1223's repository, merged with EdwinMindcraft's repository & various fixes from here and there.
However, the main goal of this fork is to provide a version that people can use on servers running Forge Essentials.
Use the "1.10.2" branch ("General" version) on clients and the "1.10.2-Server" branch ("Server" version) on servers.

I might fix game-breaking bugs as I come across them, but my time is rather limited, so I can't promise anything.
Feel free to make pull requests, just keep your code readable & clean enough, make separate commits for separate things and if you plan on making a huge commit, maybe discuss it with me first, to make sure your time won't go to waste.

--------
This is a reworked version of the Ars Magica 2 mod by Mithion.

## Moving from AM2-1.5.0 to AM2-1.5.0C

The C version (C is for Capability) requires some actions to be used in a world generated by AM2 Standard :
You'll need to use "/am2 updatespells" with the spells previously generated in your INVENTORY (spell books won't work) to update them to AM2-C, since it's using a different spell system.
Everything is mostly the same, but the power links might be broken. If your world crashes on load, try deleting the AM2PowerData folder in your world's folder.

## Currently in the API

 * Affinities

## The Compendium Update
The compendium is getting entirely reworked in a way that you'll need to add Entries in a different way that you previously did. Though this will allow you to have more that one kind of right page. For example you can check am2.defs.LoreDefs which contains all the pages definition.
